# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in this project a harassment‑free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments
- Public or private intimidation or doxxing
- Publishing others’ private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem unacceptable, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is
officially representing the project in public spaces (including online).

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening
an Issue marked **[coc]** or by contacting the maintainers privately at:
**ville.pitkakangas@centria.fi** (replace with an actual address).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
1. **Correction** — A private, written warning and clarification of expected behavior.
2. **Warning** — A public or private warning; continued behavior may lead to further action.
3. **Temporary Ban** — Temporary removal from participation (Issues, PRs, etc.).
4. **Permanent Ban** — Permanent removal from participation if behavior persists.
